   furthermore the coding style has changed from 
   0000-00([0-9A-F]0-9A-F]0-9A-F]0-9A-F]-0-9A-F]0-9A-F]) to
   0000 ([0-9A-Z][0-9A-Z][0-9A-Z][0-9A-Z])
   (2 digit for family,1 for webget,1 for subwebget)
   
 - new webget 'switch'
 
 - improved the webget wrap client code by removing rendundant code
   (construct method) and changed the method of defininig and storing the code
   ('$_.js.reg' for storing client code, $_.tmp.wid_cache as <<<- cache)
   and start migrating all client library

   in the styles registry and return the class name. Start migrating all
   webget to the cleaned version whitout in-line style
     
 - Started a complete webget reorganization
 
 - Started some compatibility test wiht IE and Opera

02-07-2012

 - New pack webgets for vertical and orrizontal layout, based upon vbox and
   hbox but I've used 'DIV' instead of 'TABLE'
   
 - hbox and vbox were considered obsolete
 
 - Complete rewrite of data:table by using 'DIV' instead of 'TABLE'
 
 - Brand new aggregation method for in line styles, from now webgets doens't
   have any more in-line styles, but dynamyc css were created instead
   
 - Brand new experimental webget feauture 'naked' which removes the main
   parent 'DIV' useful when webgets are repeated many time by using 'data'
   family parent webgets in order to reduce the size of the html
   
 - New method to identify what webget has 'painted' anonymous 'DIV' in the HTML
   data by using a special property 'uuid' and a registry code "0000-00"
   instead of 'type' + 'webget type name'
   
 - Testing php json_encode instead of my custom function, needs furter
   improvement because the data transferred 'in-line' the TAG need to escape
   quotes(data:table). I'm evalutating the possibility to tranfer data only
   through javascript
